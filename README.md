The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data, as well as manage department information.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Programming Language: Python
- Python Version: 3.8+
- Database: SQLite (Pythonâ€™s sqlite3 library)

- [Python sqlite3 Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html)

# Future Work

- implementing a RESTful API to interact with the employee directory database. This would allow external systems or applications to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via HTTP requests.
